# HSL Color Model:
    HSL stands for:
    - Hue: The type of color.
    - Saturation: The intensity or purity of the color.
    - Lightness: The brightness or darkness of the color.

# Components of HSL:
    1. Hue (`H`):
    - Hue represents the color itself and is given as an angle in degrees on the color wheel, ranging from `0` to `360`.
    - Different angles correspond to different colors:
        - `0°`: Red
        - `60°`: Yellow
        - `120°`: Green
        - `180°`: Cyan
        - `240°`: Blue
        - `300°`: Magenta
        - `360°`: Back to Red

    2. Saturation (`S`):
    - Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color, expressed as a percentage.
    - `100%` saturation means the color is fully pure, with no addition of gray.
    - `0%` saturation means the color is completely desaturated (a shade of gray).

    3. Lightness (`L`):
    - Lightness indicates how light or dark the color is, also expressed as a percentage.
    - `0%` lightness means the color is completely black.
    - `100%` lightness means the color is completely white.
    - `50%` lightness means the color is at its full intensity.
