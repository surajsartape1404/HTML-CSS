    <h2>HTML <mark>div</mark> element:</h2>
    <p>
        <li>
            The div tag in HTML is known as the division tag.
        </li>
        <li>
            The div tag is applied to HTML documents to create content segmentation in a web page, such as images, text,
            headers, footers, navigation bars, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The div tag contains both an opening and a closing tag. Since the HTML div tag helps users create different
            data
            blocks to represent different contexts, it is the most commonly used tag in web development.
        </li>
        <li>
            The div tag can be used instead of most all block-level tags and is not affecting the context of the layout
            of
            the HTML document.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since the div tag is a block-level element, it starts on a new line. The use of this HTML tag reduces the
            program's complexity for the web designer. Therefore, it is advisable to use div tags.
        </li>
    </p>

    <h2>HTML <mark>span</mark> element:</h2>
    <p>
        <li>
            The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
        </li>
        <li>
            The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
        </li>
        <li>
            The span tag is much like the div element, but div is a block-level element and span is an inline element.
        </li>

    <h2> <mark>div vs span:</mark></h2>
    <p>
        <li>
            A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, whereas a span element is
            used
            for inline organization and styling.
        </li>
    </p>
