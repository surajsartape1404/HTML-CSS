float:left|right;
    `left`: The element floats to the left of its container.
    `right`: The element floats to the right of its container.
    `none`: Default value; the element does not float.
    `inherit`: Inherits the float value from its parent element.

Float is used to keep an element floating right/left of UI.
It will remove the element from the actual flow , so that the next element will fill the gap when the current element stays left/right.

clear:left|right|both;
Note: if the next don't want floating element to be its left/right , it can use "clear" like

# Clearing Floats:

When you use float, it can sometimes cause parent elements not to wrap around the floated elements, disrupting the layout. To fix this, you need to clear the float.

- `clear` property: Used to stop elements from wrapping around floated elements.
        .clearfix {
          clear: left|right|both;
        }

# Common Issues with Float:
- Collapsed Parent Container: Floated elements can cause their parent container to collapse if not properly cleared.
- Overflowing Elements: Floated elements may overflow if not contained or cleared.

# Modern Alternatives:
While `float` was historically used for layout, modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid are now preferred for most layout tasks due to their flexibility and ease of use.
